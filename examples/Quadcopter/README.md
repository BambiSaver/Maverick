## Quadcopter Example

This example deals with a Quadcopter model and aims to find the minimum time path between two points.

With the dataset used in this example (data.lua), the quadcopter has to move from a starting point to an end point that is approximately 14km far away. Moreover, some hills are present thus the shortest path is not a straight line.

The figure 'Example_trajectory.jpg' gives an overview of the simulated optimal (i.e. minimum time) trajectory.
Energy optimisation can be achieved by proper modelling of the energy usage; this feature is planned to be added in future.
